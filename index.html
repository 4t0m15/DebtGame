        <!--Okay so heres what i was thinking. We can make the location a standard, 
        and changing locations take up 1 day in the day counter. For mafia/drug tycoon or wtv, we could 
        probably have locations for different supplies and drugs, and maybe safetly level. This would be the most skill based
        game mode, and would require the most planning and strategy for players. For stocks, you could take up a day and some money
        to move locations for acsess to different stock markets. Idk how to implement this into the random gamblin yet.
